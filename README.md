# Alarm with REED SWITCH and BUZZER in Arduino
Most alarms for home users of these switches on the doors. It usually consists of two elements, one with the sensor (reed switch), where the cables are connected, and another that contains a magnet inside. Generally these switches are normally open, but when approaching them the magnet closes, then with the doors closed they are taken as normally closed switches. The switch or sensor is a small glass bulb with two contacts that attract in the presence of a magnetic field (the magnet). In this practice we will use a magnetic switch (REED SWITCH) door contact / sensor and a BUZZER to make "noise" when a door opens. Normally the circuit is open (no connection between the two cables). The other half is a magnet. When the magnet is less than 13mm (0.5 ") a, the reed switch is closed.
The objective of the program is to simulate an alarm using a REED SWITCH and a BUZZER.
If the magnetic field of the REED SWITCH is interfered with by some signal, it sends a signal to the BUZZER and the LED so that it
turn on simulating the alarm with sound and light.
